# GitHub Copilot App for Beginners

> Learn to direct and orchestrate AI coding agents from a single desktop app.

Think of the GitHub Copilot App as a desktop cockpit for agentic coding work. It brings together sessions, plans, diffs, tests, browser previews, AI chats, issues, pull requests, and more so you can supervise the work without bouncing between multiple tools.

This course treats the app as a place to guide and review work, not a magic code button. You'll practice choosing context, picking a session mode, checking evidence, and deciding when automation is appropriate to use.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of the course, you'll be able to:

- Install and sign in to the GitHub Copilot App
- Connect a repository and use Quick chats for safe exploration
- Start sessions from prompts, issues, and pull requests
- Explain Interactive, Plan, and Autopilot modes
- Use worktree-backed sessions without colliding with your main branch
- Attach useful context with `@`, `#`, and `/`
- Review diffs, run tests, preview a web app, and validate changes
- Use My work for issues, PRs, review comments, and failing checks
- Understand where settings, instructions, skills, canvases, automations, and Agent Merge fit

The main sample used throughout the course can be found at:

```text
samples/book-app-web
```

## Target Audience

This course is designed for:

- Developers who want to orchestrate, guide, and review agent-driven coding work
- Students and self-taught learners who want a guided path
- Teams evaluating how to keep humans in control while agents do more work
- Copilot CLI or IDE Copilot users who want to understand where the desktop app fits

No agentic development experience is required. Basic GitHub, Git, and JavaScript project familiarity will help. The sample app is a small React/Vite project, so basic npm command familiarity helps in the development chapters.

## 🤖 Understanding the GitHub Copilot Family

| Product | Where it runs | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot App (this course) | Desktop app | Supervising sessions, plans, diffs, browser validation, PRs, canvases, and automations |
| GitHub Copilot in IDEs | VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, and other editors | Agents, inline suggestions, chat, and editor-centered coding |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | Terminal | Terminal-native agent work and command-line workflows |
| Copilot cloud agent | GitHub-hosted environment | Background work on issues and cloud sessions when enabled |

This course focuses on the GitHub Copilot App. Along the way, you'll see how it connects to GitHub, local tools, browser previews, terminal output, and cloud capabilities when available.

## 📚 Course Structure

| Chapter | Title | What learners do |
|:--:|---|---|
| 00 | 🚀 [Quick Start](./00-quick-start/README.md) | Prepare the course environment and verify a Quick chat |
| 01 | 👋 [First Steps](./01-first-steps/README.md) | Learn why you'd use the app, then tour key features: UI, Quick chats, settings, sessions, modes, and model controls |
| 02 | 🌳 [Sessions, Worktrees, and Context](./02-sessions-worktrees-context/README.md) | Start isolated sessions and use `@`, `#`, and `/` for context |
| 03 | ⚡ [Development and GitHub Workflows](./03-development-workflows/README.md) | Review, debug, test, and preview a change, then move it through My work, issues, PRs, review comments, checks, guided fixes, and advanced Agent Merge |
| 04 | 🧰 [Skills, Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, and Plugins](./04-skills-mcp-plugins/README.md) | Start with repo-local skills, then learn optional MCP servers, plugins, and agents |
| 05 | 🖼️ [Canvases](./05-canvases/README.md) | Use session canvases and a plan + validation board as a shared control panel |
| 06 | 🔁 [Automations](./06-automations/README.md) | Start with a manual open-work summary, then learn schedules and advanced cloud automations |

## 📖 How This Course Works

Each chapter follows the same beginner-friendly pattern:

1. A short hook that explains why the topic matters
2. Learning objectives and estimated time
3. Prerequisites when needed
4. A real-world analogy
5. Core concepts in plain language
6. Hands-on examples using `samples/book-app-web`
7. Contextual images and app screenshots to support the lesson
8. Expected output and notes about how it works
9. Troubleshooting tips and common issues
10. Key takeaways, an assignment, and navigation links

When a chapter shows a model response, remember that demo output varies. Your app version, model, reasoning setting, repository context, and enabled tools can change the response.
